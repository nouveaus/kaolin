# Kaolin: The Nouveau operating system
#### noun.
<sub>a) a soft, earthy, white clay used in the manufacture of porcelain.</sub>

Kaolin is an experimental 32-bit operating system for the x86 architecture, serving as the "clay" before the development of the adx operating system. 
Although it is meant to be a fully-fledged operating system; including a bootloader, monolithic kernel, tooling and more, it exists as a trial run for Nouveau's operating system development before the adx operating system is developed with the [adx language](https://github.com/nouveaus/adx-language).
